Although not long, I joined E-Dealer Direct and served as part of the core engineering team. In my time there, I contributed to stack discussions in an agile environment, created wireframes and mockups using Figma, and planned and developed new features using React, Redux, SCSS, Javascript, and Ruby on Rails. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, I was made redundant.

As life semi-returns to normal due to the current COVID-19 situation, I was asked to return to my position at E-Dealer Direct. In my current role, I've been tasked with leading the design, creation, and implementation of a new product to be released to take advantage of our API.
