Although not long, I joined E-Dealer Direct as part of the core engineering team. I contributed to discussions regarding overall architecture, I planned features, participated in code reviews, built out prototypes and designs using Figma, and implemented them using various technologies such as React, Redux, SCSS, Ruby on Rails and Elasticsearch.

Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 affecting our market, I was downsized as the company scaled back.
