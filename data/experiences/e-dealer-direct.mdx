Although not long, I joined E-Dealer Direct and served as part of the core engineering team. In my time there, I contributed to stack discussions in an agile environment, created wireframes and mockups using Figma, and planned and developed new features using React, Redux, SCSS, Javascript, and Ruby on Rails. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, I was made redundant.

As life semi-returns to normal due to the current COVID-19 situation, I was asked to return to my position at
E-Dealer Direct. In my current role, I operate both across the full stack and mobile development. My
typically day to day technologies in use are React, React Native, Redux, SCSS, And Ruby on Rails. I lead
product team discussions, and push out updates in a regular and timely manner, while both taking feedback
on the current release and working on the next.
