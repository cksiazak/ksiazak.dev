In my partnership with Ariana Suisse, I'm the lead developer on creating a multi-tenant, distributed system using React (& React Native), GraphQL, Apollo Federation, Styled Components, Typescript, Elasticsearch, and various AWS services. Through discussions with clients, I continually create new features or reiterate on old ones. This is done completely remote across global time zones.
