In my partnership with Ariana Suisse, I've been tasked with creating a multi-tenant microservice system using React, GraphQL, Apollo Federation, Styled Components, Typescript, and is automated using various AWS services. I hold daily meetings and bi-weekly sprint plannings with my stakeholder to plan new features or reiterate and improve old ones. This is all done completely remote across global timezones.
