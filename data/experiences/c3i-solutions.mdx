I joined C3i solutions in March of 2017, starting off as a support representative for our client Castlight Health. I was promptly promoted to Project Coordinator. From there, I assisted in developing our program from a support oriented role into a technical one.

As we transitioned through several product launches, I assisted in knowledge base development, processing reporting checks via Salesforce and JIRA, and quantified that data to determine trends. Upon leaving, I assisted in maintaining the client's relationship with Anthem by overseeing support incidents, analyzing flat files, and validating API requests.
