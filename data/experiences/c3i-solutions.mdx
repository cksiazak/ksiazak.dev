I worked in conjunction with our client, Castlight Health, across several time zones. I assisted in transitioning our program through several of our client's product launches. My regular day to day workload was maintaining our knowledge base with current issues, triaging bug reports to the appropriate teams. I also made data driven decisions through various reports from Salesforce and JIRA, and analyzed flat files and API requests from Anthem.
