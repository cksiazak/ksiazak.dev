Hello! I'm Chris, a developer born and raised in El Paso, TX. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying that knowledge in designing and creating web applications.

I am proficient in HTML, CSS and Javascript including various technologies such as React, Redux, and Nodejs. In my last position as a Software Engineer at E-Dealer Direct, I served as part of the core engineering team. Although I wasn't there for long, I did produce designs and prototypes using Figma, discussed application architecture, and worked with React, Redux, and Ruby on Rails (which I learned on the job). Unfortunately, COVID-19 struck and I'm now open to new possibilities.

In the meantime, I've partnered with Thomas Patrick and Partners Limited in building a multi-tenant system using GraphQL, Apollo Federation, Node, and React.

For over a year, I've attend Lambda School for Full Stack Web Development. and have worked with various, distributed teams of different skill sets (ranging from Data Science to UX design, as well as other developers) and designed, researched, built, and iterated over several products.

Here are some technologies I've been working with:
