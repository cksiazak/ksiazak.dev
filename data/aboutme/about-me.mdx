Hello! I'm Chris, a developer born and raised in El Paso, TX. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying that knowledge in designing and creating web applications.

I am proficient in HTML, CSS and Javascript including various technologies such as React, Redux, and Nodejs. In my last position as a Software Engineer at E-Dealer Direct, I served as part of the core engineering team. Although I wasn't there for long, I produced designs and prototypes, discussed application architecture, and built the front end using React and Redux, and the api using Rails and Searchkick. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 affecting the market, I was downsized as the company scaled back operations.

For the past year, I've attend Lambda School for Full Stack Web Development. I've worked with various, distributed teams of different skill sets (ranging from Data Science to UX design, as well as other developers) and planned through various projects.

Here are some technologies I've been working with:
