Hello! I'm Chris, a developer born and raised in El Paso, TX. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying that knowledge in designing and creating web applications.

I am proficient in HTML, CSS and Javascript including various technologies such as React, Redux, and Nodejs. Currently, I am a software engineer at E-Dealer Direct and hold a contract with my client, Arianna Suisse. At E-Dealer Direct, I lead the development of a new platform to integrate with new and existing api services. In my partnership with Arianna Suisse, I am the sole developer on a multi-tenant product automated using AWS and served via a variety of microservices using Apollo Federation.

I've attended Lambda School for Full Stack Web Development. and have worked with various distributed teams of different skill sets (ranging from Data Science to UX design, as well as other developers) and designed, researched, built, and iterated over several products.

Here are some technologies I've been working with:
