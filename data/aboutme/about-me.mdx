Welcome! I'm Chris, a developer born and raised in El Paso, TX. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying that knowledge in designing and creating web applications.

I am proficient in HTML, CSS and Javascript including various technologies such as React, Redux, and Nodejs. In my last position as a Software Engineer at E-Dealer Direct, I served as part of the core engineering team. I produced prototypes, had discussions regarding the architecture, and built out not only the React views, but also the API using Ruby on Rails and Elasticsearch, both of which I learned as needed. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 affecting the market, I was downsized as the company scaled back operations.

For over a year now, I've attend Lambda School for Full Stack Web Development. I've worked with various, distributed teams of different skill sets (ranging from Data Science to UX design, as well as other developers) and planned through various projects.

Here are some technologies I've been working with:
