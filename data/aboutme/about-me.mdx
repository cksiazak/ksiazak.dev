Hello! I'm Chris, a developer born and raised in El Paso, TX. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying that knowledge in designing and creating web applications.

I am proficient in HTML, CSS and Javascript including various technologies such as React, Redux, and Nodejs. Currently, I am a software engineer at E-Dealer Direct and also work in partnership with Arianna Suisse. At E-Dealer Direct, I work across the stack using Ruby on Rails and React, as well as mobile development using React Native. With Arianna Suisse, I handle creating and maintaining a multi-tenant system written in Typescript and automated using AWS, being served via federated GraphQL microservices with Apollo Federation.

I've attended Lambda School for Full Stack Web Development and have worked with various distributed teams of different skill sets (ranging from Data Science to UX design, as well as other developers) and designed, researched, built, and iterated over several products.

Here are some technologies I've been working with:
