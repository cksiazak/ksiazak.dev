This is the third iteration of my personal webpage (the one you're on), as I enjoy implementing new things. It is built with NextJS, styles are built with Styled Components, and all the data is populated using Markdown. In the future, I'm looking to start a blog to post ideas I've had and tutorials on issues I've encountered and resolved.
