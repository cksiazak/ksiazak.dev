SongSight allows you to choose from a list of songs, save it to your favorites, and submit it to our Data Science team's api which would return similar music based on several metrics for your given song.

For this project, I served as a Frontned Architect and lead group discussions regarding design, features, and implementation. This is built in React and uses Redux for state management.
