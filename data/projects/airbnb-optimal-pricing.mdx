I served as the sole backend engineer for this project. In building the API using Nodejs, I consulted with both the frontend and data science teams in how their interface would work, at which point I'd build around those specifications to make it easiest to implement. This API allows you to submit data for an Airbnb listing, and using our data science team's api, will return the optimal price based on data from Berlin.
