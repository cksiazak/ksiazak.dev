SwagDragon is a hassle free drag and drop store builder that allows you to sell items without keeping them in stock. We accomplish this by hooking in to a dropshipping service, so that when a user purchases one of your items, it gets created by our dropshipper and shipped directly to them.

This is currently a work in progress, but it is built using Nextjs, Styled Components, Redux, and Node.
