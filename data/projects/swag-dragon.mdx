SwagDragon is a drag and drop store builder that allows you to create your own store and products without needing to keep anything in stock. We accomplish this by hooking into a drop shipping service so that the product you create is only made when someone orders it.

This product is still a work in progress, but I'm working with 4 other developers and a UI expert in developing this application. As of right now, I've created most of the back end using Nodejs/express, and a few pages using Nextjs and Redux. We're looking at a completion around the end of May.
