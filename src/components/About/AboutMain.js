      Welcome! I'm Chris, a developer born and raised in El Paso, TX. I enjoy
      learning new technologies and applying that knowledge in designing and
      creating web applications. Currently, I am a Project Coordinator at C3i
      Solutions. I work in collaboration with our client, Castlight Health.
      Before, I attended the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) to study
      Electrical Engineering. At some point during this time, I realized that it
      wasn't a topic that I enjoyed. I joined the Full Stack Web Development
      program at Lambda School, which aided me in discovering my passion for
      tech and design.
