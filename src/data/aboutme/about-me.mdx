I'm a developer born and raised in the heart of El Paso, TX.  My "tech"  journey really started off handling user analytics and providing  support for our client, where I worked with various teams to solve and prevent future user issues by identifying ways that we could improve the product and issue resolution time to deliver better customer support to both end users and business clients.


For additional context, I started off building android kernels when I was 14. While working for C3i Solutions, I wanted to be a part of the process in truly solving user issues, thus I began my journey. I shortly joined a local startup, in which I utilized React, Ruby on Rails, and AWS. Being a part of a small team,  I was able to spearhead new customer features and products to drive acquisition. Unfortunately, COVID hit and I was laid off within a few months. Luckily, I landed a contract with Patrick Thomas and Partners, which functioned as a sort of consulting position where I was able to work with clients from all over the world and design solutions for them using React, React Native, and a federated Apollo GraphQ backend. Afterwards, I was asked to rejoin E-Dealer Direct, again wire framing (with Figma) and overseeing an entire product for commercial clients.


As I wanted to expand my horizons, I came to work for Kinsta, where I was able to learn and grow on a globally distributed team, seeing a product from the ground up, and then being transferred to a core team where I was able to lead the development of several features that are currently a core part of the main product. The company unfortunately decided to reduce their force, in which I took the opportunity to search for new horizons where I can grow and expand not only my own skills, but provide benefit elsewhere.
