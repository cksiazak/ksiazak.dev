Hello! I'm Chris, a developer born and raised in the heart of El Paso, TX.
I enjoy learning new technologies and applying that knowledge in designing and creating things that live on the web.

I am proficient in CSS and Javascript, including its various technologies such as React, Redux, Nodejs, and Apollo GraphQL.

Aside from that, I also held a contract as a consultant, and worked both directly with clients and with my contract holder.
