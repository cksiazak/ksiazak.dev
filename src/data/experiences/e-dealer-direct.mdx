Although not long, I joined E-Dealer Direct and served as part of the core engineering team of 3.
In my time short time there, I contributed to stack discussions in an agile environment, created wireframes and mockups,
and implemented features.

Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, I was made redundant.

As life was returning to normal from COVID, I was asked to
return to my position at E-Dealer Direct. While in that role, the engineering team shrunk and I took on additional responsibility.
I operated across both the web application and mobile development.
My typical day to day technologies in use were React, React Native, Redux, SCSS, and Ruby on Rails.
I led product discussions, designed layouts/wireframes using Figma and Adobe XD, and implemented features.
This was all done while pushing out updates in a regular and timely manner, while both taking feedback on the current release
and iterating on the last.
