Although not long, I joined E-Dealer Direct and served as part of the core engineering team of 3. In my time there, I contributed to stack discussions in an agile environment, created wireframes and mockups using Figma, and planned and developed new features using React, Redux, SCSS, and Ruby on Rails.

Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, I was made redundant.

As life was returning to normal from COVID, I was asked to
return to my position at E-Dealer Direct. In my current role, I operate both across
the full stack web application and own mobile development. My typically day to day technologies in use are React, React Native, Redux, SCSS, And Ruby on Rails. I own entire features from leading product team discussions, layout design and development, all while pushing out updates in a regular and timely manner, while both taking feedback on the current release and iterating on the last.
