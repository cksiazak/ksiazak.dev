As I joined Kinsta, I was on the ground floor of a new internal project from beginning to fruition. There, I was able to make my mark on the direction of the product and able to provide proper feedback on the direction of the application. Utilizing React, Node, Typescript, GraphQL, and various Google Cloud services, we were able to create something from nothing. Within that project, I lead the integration of Mixpanel for user analytics and tracking, among other features.


Afterwards, I was placed on a team within the core application and microservices, and quickly learned from there. Here too was mainly Typescript oriented, but I did have the opportunity of working with Helm, Kubernetes, Prisma, and diving deep within Docker and Google Cloud functionality. My most recent accomplishment was solely integrating Nixpacks as an additional toolchain within our applications build systems for customers utilizing Google Cloud Build and Docker, and designing and implementing a sleep system for user applications.


As with any feature I oversaw the development on, I continued to provide support and help regarding it. Whether it be documentation, or exchanging conversation to our support team for those who needed it.


Unfortunately, the company decided to reduce their force, in which I took the opportunity to exit and seek new ventures.
