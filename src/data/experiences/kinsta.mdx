Upon joining Kinsta, I was a part of a new internal project from beginning to fruition. Utilizing React, Node, Typescript, GraphQL, and various Google Cloud services, we were able to create something from nothing asynchronously with a global team. Within that project, I lead the integration of Mixpanel for user analytics and tracking.

Afterwards, I was placed on a team within the core application and microservices, and quickly learned from there. Here too was mainly Typescript oriented, but I did have the opportunity of working with Helm, Kubernetes, Prisma, and diving deep within Docker and Google Cloud functionality. My most recent accomplishment was integrating Nixpacks as an additional toolchain within our application's build system for customers, integrating with Docker, GKE, and Google Cloud Build.

As with any feature I oversaw the development on, I continued to provide support and help regarding it. Whether it be documentation, or serving as a SME for those who needed it.

The company, however, decided to reduce their force, in which I took the opportunity to exit and seek new ventures.
