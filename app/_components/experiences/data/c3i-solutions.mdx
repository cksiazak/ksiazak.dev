I worked with our client, Castlight Health, across several time zones. I assisted in transitioning our program through several of our client's product launches. My regular workload was maintaining our knowledge base with current issues, assisting in broadcasting user issues to our team, triaging bug reports to the appropriate engineering teams, and making data-driven decisions through various analytics from Salesforce and JIRA. On top of that, I maintained our client's relationship with their partner by analyzing flat files and API request issues.
