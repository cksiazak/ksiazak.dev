Brought on to assist with a complete rebuild of the platform using technologies such as Typescript, React, Express, Redis, Postgres, Docker, and Azure. Originally a team of 4, became 3 with myself floating between both front and backends.

Within this role, I led the design, integration, and system migration to a multi-node Citus cluster to enhance data isolation and improve query efficiency. I also held regular discussions with stakeholders, gathering feedback to verify feature requirements and to confirm details regarding the legacy system during the rebuild process.
