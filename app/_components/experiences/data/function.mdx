As a hobby and side project, along with friends, I founded and co-owned a local music venue specifically dedicated to Techno, House, and other underground music for the borderland area. Being a very different concept than anything I've ever dealt with, I learned to manage a business and deal with everything surrounding one, while growing from a small venue to one of the largest clubs in the southwest. We were able to push the local music scene further than I ever thought possible, and were able to host events that my city wouldn't normally have the opportunity to have.

In the end, it was exactly as tiring as it sounds, so we decided to end it and go our separate ways.
