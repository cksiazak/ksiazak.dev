In my partnership with Patrick Thomas, I was the sole developer on creating a multi-tenant, distributed system using React (& React Native), GraphQL, Apollo Federation and Apollo Client, Styled Components, Typescript, Elasticsearch, and various AWS services (EC2, SQS, Lambdas). Through stake holder discussions with my client, I was able to continually provide entire solutions whether it be on the web, or through Apple/Android applications.
