Although not long, I joined E-Dealer Direct and served as part of the core engineering team of 3. In my time there, I contributed to stack discussions in an agile environment, created wireframes and mockups using Figma, and planned and developed new features using React, Redux, SCSS, and Ruby on Rails.

Unfortunately, due to COVID happened and was part of the reduction in force. As life was returning to normal from COVID, I was asked to return to my position at E-Dealer Direct. While in that role, the engineering team shrunk and I took on additional responsibility.

I operated across both the web application and mobile development. My typical day to day technologies in use were React, React Native, Redux, SCSS, and Ruby on Rails. Being only one of two engineers at this time, I was able to lead the creation of a new B2B product.
