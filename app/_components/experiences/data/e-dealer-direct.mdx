Although not long, I joined E-Dealer Direct and served as part of the core engineering team of 3. In my time there, I contributed to stack discussions in an agile environment, created wireframes and mockups using Figma, and planned and developed new features.

Unfortunately, due to COVID, I was part of the reduction in force for about 3 months. Afterward, I was asked to return to my position at E-Dealer Direct. While in that role, the engineering team shrunk and I took on additional responsibility in which I was able to lead the development and integration of a new B2B product while maintaining ownership of the mobile application and several features in the main product.

My typical day-to-day technologies were React, React Native, Redux, SCSS, and Ruby on Rails.
