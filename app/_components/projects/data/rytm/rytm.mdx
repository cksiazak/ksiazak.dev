export const meta = {

  img: rytm
};

Being that I do have experience in throwing events, I'm currently working on Rytm, which is going to be a modernized ticketing platform for both venues and promoters, allowing them to sell tickets online, post event updates, and manage their event finances, (plus some extra goodies).

At the moment, I am building out user stories, gathering feedback from local promoters to get ideas on what features they would like to see, and building out the backend, meanwhile I sketch out ideas for a UI.

If you would like to see the codebase, feel free to reach out.
