Being that I do have experience in throwing events, I'm currently working on Rytm, which is going to be a modernized ticketing platform for both venues and promoters, allowing them to sell tickets online, post event updates, and manage their event finances, (plus some extra goodies).

At the moment, I am building out user stories, gathering feedback from local promoters to get ideas on what features they would like to see, and building out the backend, meanwhile I sketch out ideas for a UI.

This is a pretty massive side project and is utilizing typescript, NextJS, Apollo GraphQL, Docker containers managed by Kubernetes (using DevSpace), Postgres, and will be deployed on AWS. I also plan on creating a React Native application for it in the future.

If you would like to see the codebase, feel free to reach out. Keep in mind, it's mainly a boilerplate monorepo at the moment as it is also serving as a testing ground for new libraries I haven't touched before. :)
