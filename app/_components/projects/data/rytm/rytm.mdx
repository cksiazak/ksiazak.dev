Being that I do have experience in throwing events, I'm currently working on Rytm, which is going to be a modernized ticketing platform for both venues and promoters, allowing them to sell tickets online, post event updates, and manage their event finances.

At the moment, I am building out user stories and gathering feedback from local promoters to see what else they would like to see as well as utilizing AI to get ideas for design.
