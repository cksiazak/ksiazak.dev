Being that I do have experience in throwing events and this is a passion area, I'm currently working on Rytm, which is going to be a modernized ticketing platform for both venues and promoters, allowing them to sell tickets online, post event updates, and manage their event finances, (plus some extra goodies).

This is a pretty massive side project and is utilizing Typescript, NextJS, Apollo GraphQL, Docker containers managed by Kubernetes (using DevSpace), Postgres, and will be deployed on AWS. I also plan on creating a React Native application for it in the future.

If you would like to see the codebase, feel free to reach out. Keep in mind, it's mainly a boilerplate monorepo at the moment as I create user stories, get ideas from local promoters on features, and sketch out a UI. Plus it's also serving as a testing ground for new libraries I haven't touched before as I see what's the best 'fit' :)
