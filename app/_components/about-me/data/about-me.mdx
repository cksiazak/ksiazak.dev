I'm a developer born and raised in the heart of El Paso, TX. Although I grew up tinkering (and bricking) my android phones at 13, my "tech" journey really started off at C3i Solutions handling user analytics and providing support for our client, where I worked with various teams to solve and prevent future user issues, as well as interface with vendors and maintain those relationships. During this, I wanted to be a part of the process in truly solving user issues, rather than mainly just research them.

I shortly joined a local startup, and being a part of a small team, I was able to spearhead new customer features and products to drive acquisition. Unfortunately, COVID hit and I was laid off within a few months. Luckily, I landed a contract with Patrick Thomas and Partners, which functioned as a sort of consulting position where I was able to work with clients from all over the world and design solutions for their ideas. Afterwards, I was asked to rejoin E-Dealer Direct.

As I wanted to expand my horizons, I came to work for Kinsta, where I was able to learn and grow on a globally distributed team, seeing a product from the ground up, and then being transferred to a core team where I was able to lead the development of several features that are currently a cornerstone of the main product.
