I'm a (mostly) self-taught full-stack developer born and raised in the heart of El Paso, TX. Although I grew up tinkering (and bricking) my Android phones at 13, my "tech" journey started at C3i Solutions handling user analytics and providing support for our client, Castlight Health, where I worked with various teams and vendors to solve and prevent future user issues. During this, I discovered I wanted to be a part of the process of truly providing solutions.

I shortly joined a local startup, and being a part of a small team, I was able to spearhead new customer features and products to drive acquisition. During COVID, I landed a contract with Patrick Thomas and Partners, which functioned as a sort of consulting position where I could work with clients from all over the world and provide solutions for their ideas.. Shortly thereafter, I was asked to rejoin E-Dealer Direct.

As I wanted to expand my horizons, I came to work for Kinsta, where I was able to learn and grow on a globally distributed team, seeing a product from the ground up, participating in and leading several discussion groups, and ultimately working with core teams where I was able to lead the development of several features that are currently a cornerstone of the main product. 

Most recently at Pigknows, I played a major role in rebuilding the platform, leading database migration, and working across both frontend and backend to improve scalability, performance, and system enhancements.
