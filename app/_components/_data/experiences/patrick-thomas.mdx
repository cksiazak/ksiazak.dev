In my partnership with Patrick Thomas, I was the sole developer on creating a multi-tenant, distributed system using React (& React Native), GraphQL, Apollo Federation and Apollo Client, Styled Components, Typescript, Elasticsearch, and various AWS services (EC2, SQS, Lambdas). Through discussions with clients acquired through my partnership, I continually created new features or reiterated on old ones. This was done completely remote across global time zones ranging from Ireland, to Sweden, to Pakistan.
